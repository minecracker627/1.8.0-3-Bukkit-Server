# 1.8.0-3-Bukkit-Server
A Fully Compiled 1.8 Bukkit Server
When using this it is seguested to keep the server on your Desktop, also the bash scripting is writen for use
on Gameband. If a user wants to use this on a different device it is reccommended to change the starting scripts
so you are able to run it from .command and/or .sh files.
